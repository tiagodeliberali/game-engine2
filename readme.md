# Game Engine 2

My second attempt to create a 2d game engine. At this time, I am adding even more constraints to make it easier to go from pixel art to the game.

The first tool is the ablity to turn https://www.spritefusion.com/editor json and png into a working scenario.

The second is the 1:1 mapping between pixel art and the game. No scales are applied, so each asset need to be draw on the correct size :)

Also, the pipeline is not good yet... there is much work to be done.
